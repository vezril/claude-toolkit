# claude-toolkit

A curated [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) **plugin** bundling reusable **skills** and **subagents** across many domains — **software engineering** (with a comprehensive Akka suite), **communications & writing**, **personal finance**, plus networking, operating systems, DevOps, and game / web / Apple development — distilled from primary sources (books and official docs).

It began as a Scala / functional-programming toolkit and has grown into a general-purpose one. Its three most-developed pillars are **software engineering**, **communications** (writing in your own voice), and **finances** (Canadian personal finance and business setup); the rest fill out the stack around them.

The skills cross-reference each other via `[[name]]` links; the subagents apply them.

## Install (as a plugin)

This repo is both a plugin and a single-plugin marketplace. From Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add vezril/claude-toolkit
/plugin install claude-toolkit@vezril-toolkit
```

(or `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/this/repo` for a local checkout). Installed skills are namespaced `claude-toolkit:<skill>` and subagents become available for delegation automatically.

### Manual install (without the plugin system)

Copy the folders into a project's `.claude/` (or `~/.claude/` for all projects):

```bash
cp -R skills/*  /path/to/repo/.claude/skills/
cp -R agents/*.md /path/to/repo/.claude/agents/
```

## Skills

**Session priming**

- **prime** — at the start of a session, analyzes the project (structure, architecture, design patterns, conventions) from **concrete evidence** (cross-validated, confidence-labelled, asks on ambiguity — no hallucination), produces a Priming Brief, then activates the matching skills and the sdlc-orchestrator team bound to the real stack.

**Software-engineering disciplines**

- **tdd** — strict Red-Green-Refactor.
- **functional-programming** — pure core / effectful shell, immutability, ADTs, total functions, errors-as-values (woven with *Grokking Simplicity*: actions/calculations/data, copy-on-write, stratified/onion architecture); grounded in the λ-calculus foundation below.
- **lambda-calculus** — Church's model of computation and the theory beneath FP (*Michaelson*): syntax, α/β/η-reduction, normal vs applicative order & Church–Rosser, currying, Church encodings, the Y combinator, and types.
- **scala** — Scala 2.13 idioms & gotchas (incl. the `sealed abstract case class` smart-constructor pattern).
- **python** — idiomatic, modern Python 3.x from *Effective Python*, *Fluent Python*, and *Automate the Boring Stuff*: the data model/dunders, comprehensions & generators, EAFP, dataclasses/type hints, the GIL & asyncio, stdlib + automation, and tooling (venv/ruff/black/mypy/pytest), with a Scala/FP comparison lens.

- **cqrs-event-sourcing** — the event-driven data/consistency patterns (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Sagas, Domain Events) from Richardson's microservices.io + the CQRS community; why database-per-service forces them, and when not to.
- **modern-java** — Effective Java (3rd ed., all 90 items) on a Java 21 baseline with modern idioms.
- **cryptography** — Schneier's *Applied Cryptography* (with C examples) updated by *Cryptography Engineering* as the modern authority.

- **software-design** — Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* (complexity, deep modules); the design tier above clean-code.
- **secure-coding** — defensive hardening against common vulnerability classes (memory safety, injection, auth/secrets/TLS); pairs with cryptography.
- **information-theory** — Cover & Thomas: entropy, KL divergence, mutual information, source-coding & channel-capacity limits, with applications to crypto, compression, coding, and ML.

**Agentic SDLC** (multi-agent software lifecycle; BMAD + Richards & Ford + Anthropic, adapted with execution-grounded review)

**Home & IoT**

- **home-assistant** — the local-first home-automation platform (home-assistant.io): the entity/state model, automations/scripts/templating, Zigbee/Z-Wave/Matter/MQTT/ESPHome ecosystems, add-ons, recorder/statistics, and secure remote access + IoT segmentation. Pairs with the networking skills for VLANs/remote access.

**Networking** (Tanenbaum + Stevens + Network Warrior/CCNA/Network+; defensive security)

- **computer-networks** — meta/overview: the OSI/TCP-IP layered model, encapsulation, design principles, performance fundamentals; routes to the rest.
- **tcp-ip** — the protocol suite at the wire (Stevens): IP/ARP/ICMP/UDP/TCP, DNS/DHCP/NAT, handshake/congestion/MTU, reading captures.
- **network-engineering** — build & operate: subnetting/VLSM, VLANs/STP, routing (OSPF/BGP), NAT, and a bottom-up troubleshooting method.
- **network-security** — defensive infrastructure security: defense-in-depth/zero-trust, segmentation, firewalls/IDS/IPS, VPNs, DDoS defense, monitoring & IR.

**Version control & CI/CD**

- **git** — the model (objects/DAG/refs/index) plus best-practice workflows: branching/merging/rebasing, conflict resolution, clean history & reflog recovery, collaboration/PRs, commit conventions, tags/releases (from *Mastering Git* + *Git Best Practices Guide*).
- **github-actions** — automating CI/CD with GitHub Actions: workflow syntax, events/jobs/matrix, writing actions, runners, secrets/OIDC, reusable workflows, and security hardening (from *Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions*).
- **github-new-repo** — create a brand-new empty GitHub repo (name + public/private as parameters), `main` seeded with an empty initial commit so protection and PRs work from day one.
- **github-branch-protection** — apply the standard `protect-main` ruleset to a repo (require PR with 0 approvals, block force-push and deletion); idempotent.
- **repo-starter-docs** — write a basic `README.md` and MIT `LICENSE.md` into the working tree (no commit — that's git-ship's job). `LICENSE.md` is the toolkit-wide standard for scaffolded projects.
- **git-ship** — commit on a feature branch, push, open the PR, and merge — merge gated on explicit human authorization unless auto mode was explicitly enabled for the run.

**Scala service scaffolding** (the decomposed successor to the retired `new-scala-service` monolith — see `archive/`)

- **scala-sbt-build** — the sbt build definition: two-module (pure core / Pekko server) `build.sbt` with all library dependencies, `project/` plugins (dynver, native-packager, scalafmt/scalafix, scoverage, buildinfo), formatter/linter configs, `.gitignore`; package root parameterized (default `me.cference`); enriches the README's Getting-started section after repo-starter-docs.
- **scala-pekko-server** — production sources only: core `Greeting`, `Main`, `HttpServer` (coordinated shutdown), hello + health routes, `AppConfig`, `application.conf`, `logback.xml`. Never touches tests.
- **scala-pekko-tests** — test sources only: `GreetingSpec` + route specs; reads the real package from the generated production code. Never touches production. (The dev pair's territory rule, applied to scaffolding.)
- **github-actions-scala-ci** — ci.yml (format / compile+test+coverage / dynver sanity / gitleaks), dev.yml (`:dev` images), release.yml (immutable semver images + GitHub Release), setup-scala composite action; image publishing skips gracefully when `DOCKERHUB_*` secrets are absent.
- **dockerhub-setup** — create the Docker Hub repo, mint a `<repo>-ci` access token via the Hub API (loud fallback to the admin PAT if minting fails), and pipe both values into GitHub Actions secrets; credentials from env only, never echoed.

**Python project scaffolding** (the Python sibling of the Scala set: uv + ruff + mypy + pytest, same territory rules)

- **python-uv-build** — pyproject.toml (hatchling src layout, dev group ruff/mypy/pytest, tool config), `.python-version`, `.gitignore`, multi-stage uv Dockerfile (`python -m <pkg>`, no HEALTHCHECK — the entry point is a CLI); package name derives scala-consistently (`athena-service` → `athena`); `uv.lock` deliberately not scaffolded (the verify gate's `uv sync` generates it); enriches the README after repo-starter-docs.
- **python-package** — production sources only: `src/<pkg>/` with the pure typed greeting module and the `__main__` CLI entry. Never touches tests.
- **python-tests** — test sources only: `tests/test_greeting.py`; reads the real package from `src/`. Never touches production.
- **github-actions-python-ci** — ci.yml (ruff lint, ruff format check as its own job, mypy, pytest via `uv sync --locked`, gitleaks), dev.yml (`:dev` images), release.yml (immutable semver images + GitHub Release), setup-uv composite action; image publishing skips gracefully when `DOCKERHUB_*` secrets are absent.

**Communications & writing**

- **calvin-voice** — drafts prose in the author's own writing voice (vault notes, journal entries, emails, chat replies, posts) so it reads as if he wrote it from scratch, not as a rewrite. Built eval-driven from a stylometric fingerprint of ~130k words of his own writing plus curated exemplars, with three registers (notes / journal / guide). Triggers only when asked to draft prose to send or publish as his own — never on code or client deliverables. Ships with the fingerprint pipeline (baseline + re-runnable stylometry script) so it can be rebuilt as the vault grows.
- **detect-ai** — local stylometric estimate (0–100, per-signal breakdown) of how AI-drafted a text reads: burstiness, cliché density, hedging, structural uniformity. Honest-confidence by design: no detector is reliable, results are never proof, and it refuses to be used to accuse a specific person of misconduct. Fully local — no text leaves the machine. *(Adapted from a third-party skill; safety-reviewed and rewritten — the original sent text + an API key to a paid service.)*
- **humanize** — edits stilted, AI-drafted, or over-formal prose to read naturally (rhythm variance, cliché removal, real stances, `--touch light|standard|deep`), with a hard scope boundary: refuses detector-evasion and academic-misrepresentation framing, and never fabricates "human" details. *(Adapted from a third-party detector-bypass tool; the bypass purpose was removed, not carried.)*
- **cold-email** — 50–125-word cold outreach drafts on AIDA/PAS/BAB with honesty guardrails: no fabricated personalization, no bait-and-switch subjects, no fake urgency, spam-law reminder for bulk. Drafts only — never sends. *(Adapted from a third-party skill.)*
- **follow-up** — re-engage a non-responder without nagging: bump → value-add → breakup matched to follow-up number, each shorter than the last, always a new angle; advises stopping after #3, and the breakup must be honest — no fake-breakups engineered for more outreach. *(Adapted from a third-party skill.)*
- **readability** — Flesch/Flesch-Kincaid/Fog/SMOG computed by a bundled stdlib-only Python script ("compute, don't estimate" — LLM syllable-counting is unreliable), then interpreted: audience fit plus three fixes quoting the actual text. *(Adapted from a third-party skill; script reviewed + executed here.)*
- **word-stats** — exact word/character/sentence/paragraph counts, reading & speaking time, vocabulary stats via a bundled stdlib-only script; one table, zero prose, no questions asked. *(Adapted from a third-party skill; script reviewed + executed here.)*

**Toolkit maintenance**

- **toolkit-archive** — retire a toolkit component into `archive/<name>/` with a `RETIRED.md` (what / why / replaced-by / date), de-index it from this README, and remove stale `~/.claude` installs; refuses while active components still reference it.
- **merge** — the end-of-change train: merge the gated PR → tag `vX.Y.Z` on merged `main` (fires release.yml where present) → `openspec archive` + land the bookkeeping. One invocation authorizes the train's merges; failing checks, uninvented versions, and ambiguity are absolute stops. Composes with git-ship: git-ship gets changes *to* the gate, merge takes them from it.

**Design**

- **ux-design** — *Laws of UX*: psychology-based UX heuristics (Fitts/Hick/Miller/Jakob/Gestalt/…); pairs with the SwiftUI / apple-dev skills.

**Personal finance & money**

- **personal-finance** — Hallam's *Balance* + Alini's *Money Like You Mean It* (Canadian): spending for happiness ("afford anything but not everything") and low-cost index investing, plus the practical toolkit — debt/credit, rent-vs-buy & mortgages, income/side hustles, insurance, wills, and couples/family money. Educational, not financial advice.
- **canadian-registered-accounts** — authoritative CRA mechanics for the FHSA, RRSP, and Home Buyers' Plan (eligibility, $8k/$40k & $60k limits, deductibility, repayment, FHSA+HBP stacking). Date-stamped; verify against canada.ca. Not tax advice.
- **canadian-business-registration** — starting/registering a business in Canada (Quebec focus): legal forms, the Québec REQ/NEQ, federal vs provincial incorporation, the CRA business number & program accounts, and the Quebec GST/QST-via-Revenu-Québec twist. Date-stamped; not legal/tax advice.

**Games**

- **swgoh-expert** — Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes expert assistant (teams, counters, mods, relics, GAC/TW/Conquest).

**Apple / Swift** (contributed; `apple-dev` meta added to route among them)

- **apple-dev** — meta/overview: the entry point and router for the Apple/Swift cluster below.
- **swiftui-ui-patterns** · **swiftui-view-refactor** · **swiftui-liquid-glass** · **swiftui-performance-audit** — building, refactoring, styling (iOS 26+ Liquid Glass), and auditing SwiftUI.
- **swift-concurrency-expert** — Swift 6.2+ concurrency review and remediation.
- **native-app-profiling** · **ios-debugger-agent** — profiling macOS/iOS apps (xctrace) and building/running/debugging on the simulator.
- **release-macos-spm-packaging** · **release-app-store-changelog** — SwiftPM macOS app packaging/signing and App Store release notes.
- **github-issue-fix-flow** — end-to-end GitHub issue → fix → build/test → push workflow.
- **webkit** — building browsers and web-content apps on Apple WebKit: the WKWebView embedding surface by browser-building task (navigation policy, JS↔native via content worlds, content-rule-list blocking, data stores/private browsing/profiles, downloads, permissions), the multi-process model, `isInspectable` debugging, ITP mechanics + the tracking-prevention/security policies, ports/contributing/LGPL, and feature status (flags, css-status, standards-positions). From the Apple docs + webkit.org primary sources; `references/` carry the depth.

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter `name` + `description`, then the body); larger skills add `references/*.md` loaded on demand.

## Subagents

In `agents/` (see [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) for the frontmatter spec):

- **scala-fp-reviewer** — reviews Scala / functional code against the FP, Scala, TDD, and design-patterns skills.
- **akka-architect** — designs and reviews Akka systems using the Akka suite plus DDD and EventStorming.
- **git-and-ci-reviewer** — reviews Git hygiene (commits, branches, history) and GitHub Actions workflows for correctness and security.
- **personal-finance-advisor** — a warm, fiduciary-spirited money companion (budgeting, debt, low-cost investing, Canadian FHSA/RRSP/HBP) who educates and weighs trade-offs rather than selling or prescribing.
- **sdlc-orchestrator** · **requirements-analyst** · **solution-architect** · **story-planner** · **qa-test-architect** — the agentic-SDLC team: coordinate the pipeline, write the PRD/SRS, design the architecture, decompose into stories, and own the (execution-grounded) test strategy.
- **network-architect** · **network-troubleshooter** — design networks (addressing/segmentation/routing/zones) and diagnose connectivity/performance issues (execution-grounded: ping/traceroute/dig/tcpdump).
- **game-dev-orchestrator** · **game-designer** · **game-systems-architect** · **gameplay-programmer** · **level-designer** · **playtest-lead** · **technical-artist** · **game-producer** — the Game Dev Studio: drive the lifecycle, design, architect, implement (Godot), design levels/PCG, run playtests (the fun gate), shaders/juice, and production/launch.
- **frontend-reviewer** · **full-stack-architect** — review React/Vue/TS/HTML/CSS (hooks rules, a11y, perf, XSS) and design full-stack web architecture (stack, rendering strategy, API/data/auth, deploy).
- **webkit-developer** — builds and debugs WKWebView-based browsers/web views end to end (delegates, JS bridges, content blocking, data stores, downloads, Inspector debugging) and prepares WebKit-style patches for upstreaming.
- **calvin-voice-writer** — drafts prose in Calvin's own writing voice (notes, emails, messages, posts) using the calvin-voice skill; for prose he'll send as his own, never code.

(See [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) for the full list.)

## Workflows

In `workflows/` — deterministic multi-agent scripts for Claude Code's Workflow tool. They are
not part of the plugin install; copy them to `.claude/workflows/` (project) or
`~/.claude/workflows/` (user) to make them invocable by name.

- **new-github-project** — end-to-end new-project bootstrap chaining the four skills above:
  create the local dir + empty GitHub repo (`github-new-repo`) → protect `main`
  (`github-branch-protection`; degrades with a loud warning where the plan forbids it, e.g.
  private repos on the free plan) → `openspec init --tools claude` → write starter docs
  (`repo-starter-docs`) → commit/PR (`git-ship`).
  Args: `{ name, visibility: 'public'|'private', auto?: true, docs?: true, ship?: true }`.
  `docs:false, ship:false` = **bare mode** (repo + protection only, returns synchronously) —
  the primitive that flavor workflows compose. The merge waits for human approval unless
  `auto` is passed.
- **new-scala-pekko-service** — the Scala 3 + Pekko flavor: bare bootstrap → decomposed
  scaffold on `feat/scaffold` (scala-sbt-build → scala-pekko-server → scala-pekko-tests →
  repo-starter-docs → README enrichment → github-actions-scala-ci) → optional dockerhub-setup →
  `sbt` green gate (red ships nothing) → one gated PR. Args: `{ name, visibility, dockerhub,
  auto?, pkgRoot? }` — `visibility` and `dockerhub` are required decisions, ask the human.
  After the merge, `development` is created from merged `main`. Vs. the old monolith:
  README/LICENSE come from repo-starter-docs (`LICENSE.md` standard) and the OpenSpec
  surface comes from the bootstrap's `openspec init --tools claude` — the scala scaffold
  scripts own neither.
- **new-python-project** — the Python 3.12 + uv flavor, same shape: bare bootstrap →
  scaffold on `feat/scaffold` (python-uv-build → python-package → python-tests →
  repo-starter-docs → README enrichment → github-actions-python-ci) → optional
  dockerhub-setup → uv green gate (`uv sync` + ruff check + format check + mypy + pytest;
  the generated `uv.lock` ships with the PR; red ships nothing) → one gated PR;
  `development` from merged `main` post-approval. Args: `{ name, visibility, dockerhub,
  auto?, pkg? }` — `visibility` and `dockerhub` are required decisions, ask the human.
